# Airbnb Clone Project

# Overview
This project is a simplified clone of **Airbnb**, built to practice modern web development concepts.  
The main goals of the project are:
- To replicate core features of Airbnb such as property listings, search, and booking flow.  
- To gain hands-on experience with front-end development, state management, and data persistence.  
- To strengthen skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and API integration.  
- To build a responsive, user-friendly interface with real-world design patterns.
